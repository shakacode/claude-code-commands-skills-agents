# claude-code-commands-skills-agents

ShakaCode Team Shared Claude Code commands plus cross-tool prompts, agents, skills, and tips.

## Quick Install

Copy what you need to your `~/.claude/` directory:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/shakacode/claude-code-commands-skills-agents.git
cd claude-code-commands-skills-agents

# Install all commands
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cp commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Install all agents
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Or install specific ones
cp commands/self-review.md ~/.claude/commands/
cp commands/merge-commit-msg.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

For project-level sharing, copy to your project's `.claude/commands/` or `.claude/agents/` directory instead.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`/address-review`](commands/address-review.md) | Fetch GitHub PR review comments, triage them, create todos for must-fix items, reply to comments, and resolve addressed threads |
| [`/review-all-prs`](commands/review-all-prs.md) | Review all open PRs or a specific PR, post reviews to GitHub |
| [`/self-review`](commands/self-review.md) | Comprehensive self-review of uncommitted changes before creating a PR |

## Prompt Templates

Use these when you want a reusable workflow outside Claude Code's slash-command system:

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`address-review`](prompts/address-review.md) | Shared prompt for Codex, GPT, or another coding assistant that mirrors `/address-review` and falls back cleanly when terminal access is unavailable |

Prompt templates are not auto-installed commands. For Codex, point `AGENTS.md` at the prompt you want used. For GPT, paste the prompt into a session or add it to your project or custom instructions.

## Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`pr-testing-agent`](agents/pr-testing-agent.md) | Identify and run only the tests affected by PR changes |

Install to `~/.claude/agents/` (personal) or `.claude/agents/` (project).

## Templates

Starter templates for new projects:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [`CLAUDE.md`](templates/CLAUDE.md) | Project-level Claude Code instructions template |
| [`AGENTS.md`](templates/AGENTS.md) | Cross-tool AI agent instructions template (works with Codex CLI, Cursor, etc.) |

## Syncing Commands to Your Project

This repo is the canonical source for shared commands like `/address-review`. To keep a project in sync:

### One-Time Setup

```bash
# From your project root
BOOSTERS=~/.claude/claude-code-boosters

# Clone (or pull if already cloned)
if [ -d "$BOOSTERS" ]; then
  git -C "$BOOSTERS" pull --rebase
else
  git clone https://github.com/shakacode/claude-code-boosters.git "$BOOSTERS"
fi

# Copy the commands you want into your project
mkdir -p .claude/commands
cp "$BOOSTERS/commands/address-review.md" .claude/commands/
```

### Keeping Up to Date

Run `bin/sync-commands` from this repo to pull the latest commands into a target project:

```bash
# Sync all commands to a project
./bin/sync-commands ~/projects/my-app

# Sync a specific command
./bin/sync-commands ~/projects/my-app address-review
```

### For AI Agents in Consuming Repos

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` so agents know where shared commands come from:

```markdown
## Shared Commands

The `/address-review` command is synced from
[claude-code-boosters](https://github.com/shakacode/claude-code-boosters).
Do not edit `.claude/commands/address-review.md` directly — update the
canonical copy in the boosters repo and re-sync.
```

See the [templates/](templates/) directory for starter `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` files that include this pattern.

## Contributing

1. Add new commands to `commands/`
2. Add new prompt templates to `prompts/` when the workflow targets Codex, GPT, or other non-Claude tools
3. Add new agents to `agents/`
4. Add documentation to `docs/`
5. Keep everything generic -- project-specific instructions belong in project CLAUDE.md files
6. All files must end with a newline character
